## Vision

## Governance

Vlingo is an inclusive Open Source project lead by [Vaughn Vernon][vernon-gh].

Meanwhile the long term vision is lead by him, each component has at least one _responsible_. The component responsible is accountable of:

- Mentor newcomers
- Ensure the new features match the project vision
- Takes into account what the team is capable to deliver
- Review Pull Requests & checks if it meets the Definition of Done

Each project has the list of collaborators and his/her roles. Notice people might be contributing in his/her free time.

### How to become a contributor

Quite straight forward, share your interest in implement a new feature or bug. We will give you commit access to the specific repository.

### How to become a maintainer

A maintainer is someone that shown commitment during a long period of time. It is granted as a merit of his/her contributions.

### Reasons to remove a contributor/maintainer

1. Break the [Code of Conduct][coc]
