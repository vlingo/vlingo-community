## Vision

The vlingo/platform is the Domain-Driven Design friendly open source distributed computing platform simplifying reactive, event-driven, microservices architectures.

We aggressively advance software developer DDD and Reactive capabilities to help deliver excellent software solutions. We are committed to balancing the right technology choices with your essential and unique business vision. We champion simplicity, which requires special discipline and determination.

## Governance

The vlingo/platform is an inclusive open source project lead by [Vaughn Vernon][vernon-gh], who provides long-term vision, architecture, and development. Each component has at least one _responsible champion_. The component champion is responsible for:

- Mentoring newcomers
- Ensuring that new features match the project vision
- Takeing into account what the team is capable of delivering
- Reviewing Pull Requests and checking whether or not new contributions meet the _Definition of Done_

We recognize and value everyone's contribution and time spent. We want our shared development efforts to be pleasant and productive. The following information will help you do that.

### How to become a contributor

We want you the add value, and know you have value to contribute. Share what you are interest in by implement a new feature or fixing one or more bugs.
